## What is [Salamsaidi.com](https://salamsaidi.com)?
Salam Saidi is my sister. [Salamsaidi.com](https://salamsaidi.com) is her website. The problem is that it is too slow, so I am helping her re-code it.
## Can you tell me more about Salam?
If you look in the bio section (in the navbar), you can find plenty of information of her in the family section, and you can find pictures in the other section (eventually)
## Why do you want to help her re-code it?
Well, I figure that since she is my sister, I might as well help her out on this. That is why it is in the projects section in the navbar.
## Where is her website?
[Salamsaidi.com](https://salamsaidi.com)

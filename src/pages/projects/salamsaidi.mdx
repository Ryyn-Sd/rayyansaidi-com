# [Salamsaidi.com](https://salamsaidi.com)
## What is [Salamsaidi.com](https://salamsaidi.com)?
Salam Saidi is my sister. [Salamsaidi.com](https://salamsaidi.com) is her website. The problem is that it is too slow, so I am helping her re-code it.
## Can you tell me more about Salam?
If you look in the bio section (in the navbar), you can find plenty of information of her.
## Why do you want to help her re-code it?
Well, I figure that since she is my sister, I might as well help her out on this. That is why it is in the projects section in the navbar.
## Were is her website?
I know that you might find this heading useless, here is the link anyway: [salamsaidi.com](https://salamsaidi.com)

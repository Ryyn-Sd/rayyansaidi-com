# Family

## Were we come from
Our family came from the middle east. My mom was born in Lebonan, and moved to Senagal when she was around 4, right before the cival war started there. My dad's dad was born in Syria and grew up there. His mom and he was born in Lebonan. My dad ended up growing up during the war which lasted 15 years! The houses right next to his house were unfortantly bombed, and he was very lucky to still be alive!

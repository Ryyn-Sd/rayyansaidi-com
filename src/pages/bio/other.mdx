## COVID-19 Pandemic
I spent all of 2020 and the predictions say 1/2 of 2021 during a pandemic that is deadly. It was difficult because no body was going to work because of fear of getting the desise, which meant that nobody had the mony and buisnesses were struggling. It only got worse when a lot of black people got killed by police, and now there is a racial crises. This is just part of the reason why nobody can wait untill 2021!

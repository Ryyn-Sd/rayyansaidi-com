    <p>Our family came from the middle east. My mom was born in Lebonan, and moved to Senagal when she was around 4, right before the cival war started there. My dad's dad was born in Syria and grew up there. His mom and he was born in Lebonan. My dad ended up growing up during the war which lasted 15 years! The houses right next to his house were unfortantly bombed, and he was very lucky to still be alive!</p>

    <h2 id="covid-19-pandemic">COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>
    <p>I spent all of 2020 and the predictions say 1/2 of 2021 during a pandemic that is deadly. It was difficult because no body was going to work because of fear of getting the desise, which meant that nobody had the mony and buisnesses were struggling. It only got worse when a lot of black people got killed by police, and now there is a racial crises. This is just part of the reason why nobody was able to wait for 2021!</p>

    <h1>Family</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Our family came from the middle east. My mom was born in Lebonan and moved to Senegal when she was around 4, right before the civil war started there. My granddad was born in Syria and grew up there. He and his mom were born in Lebonan. My dad ended up growing up during a war that lasted 15 years! The houses right next to his were disastrously
      bombed, and he was lucky to be alive!

    <h2>COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>
    <p>
      I am spending all of 2020, and half of 2021, during a deadly pandemic. It is difficult because nobody went to work because of fear of getting the disease, which meant nobody had money, and businesses were struggling. It only got worse when many black people started getting killed by police becasue of their race, and now there is a racial crisis.
